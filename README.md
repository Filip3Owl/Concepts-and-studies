# Machine Learning Studies Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning algorithms repository!

Here I share simple and didactic codes to learn the basic and advanced concepts of ML.

## Contents

- **Classic Algorithms**: Regression, Classification, Clustering.
- **Neural Networks**: Basic implementations in PyTorch/TensorFlow.
- **Datasets**: Examples with data ready for testing.
- **Notebooks**: Step-by-step tutorials.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Filip3Owl/algorithms-aprendizado-maquina
```

2. Access the folder of the algorithm you want to test and run:

```bash

python name_of_algorithm.py

```

## Contributions

Suggestions and improvements are welcome! Just open an **Issue** or send a **Pull Request**.
