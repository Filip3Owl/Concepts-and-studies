    "# Rule-Based Algorithms for Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule-based stemming algorithms**, such as the well-known **Porter Stemmer**, are widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to reduce words to their root or base forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms operate on a set of **predefined rules and heuristic methods** designed to remove suffixes and transform words. The core principle involves identifying common patterns in word endings and applying a series of rules to strip them. For example, the Porter algorithm has rules specifically for handling plural forms, verb conjugations, and adjective endings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Porter Stemmer processes words through **multiple phases**, each targeting specific types of suffixes. For instance, an early phase might remove common plurals like \"-s\" or \"-es\", while subsequent phases address verb forms like \"-ing\" or \"-ed,\" and other adjective/adverb suffixes. These rules are applied in a specific order to ensure correct stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, applying the Porter algorithm to \"running\" would involve removing the \"-ing\" suffix, resulting in \"run.\" Similarly, for \"dogs,\" the algorithm identifies and removes the plural \"-s,\" yielding the root \"dog.\" The algorithm systematically applies its rules, iterating until no further suffixes can be removed.\n",
