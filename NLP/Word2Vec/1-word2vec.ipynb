    "According to Almeida and Xexéo (2019), the development of **prediction-based models for word representations (embeddings)** is intrinsically linked to the history of **Neural Network Language Models (NNLMs)**, as embeddings were initially conceived as the raw vector projection in the first \"representation layer\" of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of NNLMs has primarily been one of **gradual efficiency gains**, occasional insights, and trade-offs between model complexity and the ability to train with larger datasets. Early results showed NNLMs outperformed n-gram based predecessors in language modeling, but **long training times (days to weeks)** were a significant hurdle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mikolov et al. (2013) noted that while methods like LSA and LDA existed for creating continuous word representations, their Word2Vec studies focused on **distributed word representations learned by neural networks**. These neural network-based embeddings demonstrated superior performance in preserving linear relationships between words compared to LSA. Furthermore, LDA proved computationally expensive for large datasets. To evaluate model architectures, Mikolov et al. (2013) introduced a **computational complexity metric** measuring the number of parameters accessed during training. The goal was to maximize model accuracy while minimizing computational complexity, striking a balance between performance and efficiency in word representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"nonlinear\" models proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013) were two new architectures designed to learn distributed word representations with reduced computational complexity. A key observation was that most of the complexity stemmed from the nonlinear hidden layer typical of neural networks. While this nonlinearity is a strength of neural networks, the researchers opted to explore **simpler models**. Although these simpler models might not represent data as precisely as full neural networks, they could be trained **much more efficiently on significantly larger datasets**."

    "A proposed architecture, similar to a feedforward NNLM, removes the nonlinear hidden layer and shares the projection layer across all words, not just the projection matrix.
